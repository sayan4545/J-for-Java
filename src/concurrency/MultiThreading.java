    /*
    In java multithreading is the concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize the utilization of CPU.
    multithreading capabilities are part of java.lang package.

    In a single core environment the multithreading is handled by jvm and OS that switch between threads to
    give an illusion of concurrency.
    The threads share single core, time slicing is utilized to manage the thread execution.

    For multi core environments, JVM distruibutes the threads to execute true parallel execution
    of threads

    When a program starts, one thread starts running immediately that is called the
    main thread. This thread is rsponsible for execution of the main
    method
